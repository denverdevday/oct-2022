# We're back

We had to cancel our 2020 and 2021 events. But not this time! Welcome to October 2022 Denver Dev Day.

## What is Denver Dev Day?

Welcome to Denver Dev Day, Colorado's premier, local community-organized developer event. With presentation topics ranging from desktop, micro-services, and web development to patterns, the cloud, and soft skills, Denver Dev Day is your awesome, free, day-long resource for developer learning. It's a developer conference, silly!

## Where is it?

Microsoft is a recurring sponsor for Denver Dev Day and has provided our venue space for nearly 8+ years. We're grateful for their continued sponsorship; find out more about our great venue in the event site details. So where is it? The beautiful Microsoft Denver office which is a great facility for this sort of thing. It's easy to get to with hotels and restaurants in arm's reach. 

### TODO

Tell your manager it's time to sharpen the saw. Tell your manager when you get smarter the business gets better. Tell your manager October 21st (it's a Friday) is on your calendar and the whole development team is coming to Denver Dev Day. And, if you are working on neat technology that you could share with other developers in our developer community, step up â€“ let this year be the year you submit a talk to Denver Dev Day.
