# We're back

We had to cancel our 2020 and 2021 events. But not this time! Welcome to October 2022 Denver Dev Day.

## What is Denver Dev Day?

Denver Dev Day is Coloradoâ€™s best, community-led developer event! Enjoying every topic that can impact developers from desktop to database, devops to developer tools, web, mobile, machine learning and soft skills. Denver Dev Day has seen it all and welcomes innovative content.
