# Sponsorship

Denver Dev Day is making plans for our next event, to be held at the Microsoft Office in the Denver Tech Center on October 21st, 2022. 
The success of Denver Dev Day is, in part, due to our sponsors. For a cash donation, your company or group can enjoy excellent exposure 
to a segment of your target audience.

We take it seriously to give your organization the exposure you deserve in front of the best, local audience anyone could muster. 
We have several sponsorship packages available (see below) to best fit your needs. You can feel secure that your contributions will 
help this important aspect of the IT community.
