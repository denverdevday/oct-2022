# Tell your manager! Denver Dev Day is on Friday, October 21, 2022
## July 18, 2022

Hey Developer,

**tl;dr;** Get this on your calendar and approved by your manager today.

Let’s talk about talking to your manager about Denver Dev Day on Friday, October 21. With three months’ notice, this is a breeze. You probably don’t have anything conflicting on your calendar and with this kind of notice, it will be easy to move. Then, drop an all-day placeholder on that Friday, set to show you are Out-of-Office. Step one is done. 

Talk to your manager. Do you have an upskill plan? You should – your company wants you to be a great developer. But what’s the path to great? The path to great includes an upskilling plan, that’s for sure. Those take time & money. Denver Dev Day is a great suggestion here. It is one intense day of learning and it’s completely free. You don’t even pay for parking. Like I said, this is easy. Just remind your manager how little training you’ve gone to in the past two years & how fundamental it is for developers to grow.

But why Denver Dev Day? This is the twelfth Denver Dev Day, resurrected like a freaking phoenix from the Covid nonsense that separated us all. Back because it’s what we need. Denver Dev Day does not focus on just one technology or one technology stack. We don’t cater to companies or anything like that. We’re about learning. What we do is give a voice to the vibrant developer community in this area. What are you working on? What are you learning? What can you share? What can I learn? There’s a good reason we come back every year and always sell out. Denver Dev Day is exactly what you need – a chance to peek into other development teams and learn from them for a day.

Listen, you’ve been to brown bags, lunch and learns, and other internal meetings where you share what you learn. They are great – sometimes. Denver Dev Day is a little like that except it is dipping way outside the gene pool. It’s about being effective and conveying knowledge, not checking some box. Denver Dev Day is all about new ideas, new techniques, new technologies, and new people. A different voice than the drumbeat of your internal team. A chance to watch & listen, interact & question, then mull it all over with a free sandwich & the developer sitting next to you. When you come back, you’ll have things of your own to share – if that’s your thing. 

Send an email or schedule a meeting with your manager today. A free, one day event is easy to approve. Maybe you want to bring a colleague? Do it. Plan for it. Mentoring is awesome too! Tickets for Denver Dev Day will go “on sale” in about a month, but TODAY is the time to make plans & get it on the books. We welcome you to Denver Dev Day and look forward to seeing you there. This note is just a nudge in the right direction to plan accordingly and make your visit a convenient one.

Best regards,

Jerry Nixon & the Denver Dev Day planning team
