# Welcome speakers

**Thank you for considering Denver Dev Day**

Denver Dev Day welcomes you. As a speaker at Denver Dev Day, you get the opportunity to speak to a 
thoughtful audience of bright technologists and eager developers from a thriving local community. 
This is our thirteenth Denver Dev Day.  

## Who should submit talks? 

We welcome any and all to speak at our event and actively encourage under-represented groups to 
submit talks and participate in the event. We are conginually working with a number of groups to 
promote inclusivity and diversity at our conference. All submissions are welcome.

## What level should your talk be?

The most successful talks are often level 100 or 200 talks. That does not mean you cannot submit
and advanced talk. It's just lower level talks tend to reach a broader audience. It is up to you.

## How many talks can you submit? 

As many as you like. We generally only choose one (maybe two) per speaker. If you are traveling to Denver, 
be sure to let us know. We'll consider multiple sessions for speakers traveling to Denver Dev Day.

## What topic should your talk cover? 

We have several tracks, like: Client, Web, Data and Cloud. If you can't fit your topic in one of those, 
we'll create a track for you. We're open to new ideas, but, remember the dev in Denver Dev Day is for Developer.

**Tip:** we love talks on design patterns and development techniques.

$$ How long should your talk be? 

We have two session lengths: regular and lightning. Regular sessions are just under an hour depending 
how many sessions are accepted; lightning talks are 10 to 15 minutes depending on how many talks are accepted. 

**Tell us:** anything special with your talk? (time of day you are available, unique facility set-up, etc.)

_We look forward to seeing your submission._
