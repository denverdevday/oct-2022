# Code of Conduct

As event and experience organizers, we seek to provide a respectful, friendly, professional experience for everyone, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate any behavior that is degrading to any gender, race, sexual orientation, or disability, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would be deemed harassment or discrimination. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by our standards and we encourage everyone to assist in creating a safe and welcoming environment.

    * Listen with purpose and create space for others’ communication preferences.
    * Ask yourself how you can make someone life easier.
    
2. Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and preferences.
    * Recognize that not everyone is using their native language. Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.

    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain from commenting.
    
4. Be respectful and inclusive

    * Seek to understand and build bridges, not condemn or criticize.

5. Be open and curious
    * Assume good intent and interpret others’ statements or questions in good faith.
    * Ask questions to understand, not denounce.
    * Focus on continuous learning. Improve upon the things you already know, tackle new things, and ask others about their expertise to deepen your own knowledge.
